# rji/dotfiles
These are my personal dotfiles.

## Setup
Currently I clone this repo to my other systems and symlink to files/directories within it. Eventually I'll write a script to automate the process.

## Kudos
There are a few different projects mixed in with this repo and I'd like to make sure those responsible get credit for their work:

  * Puppet Labs, for [puppet.vim](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/tree/master/ext/vim/)
  * Tim Sharpe's [vim-puppet](https://github.com/rodjek/vim-puppet)
  * Matt Wozniski's [Tabular](https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular)

# rji/dotfiles
These are my personal dotfiles.

## Setup
Clone this repo to ~/.dotfiles

    $ git clone git@github.com:rji/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

Assuming the current working directory is the root of your home directory, run the setup script

    $ .dotfiles/setup.sh

The first time that Vim is started, it will download the necessary Vundle bundles.
